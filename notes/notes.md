# Introduction to Data Warehousing and Data Mining
## Summary 
## Data Mining
* Extraction of interesting patterns from huge amounts of dta
* Also known as:
  * knowledge discovery in databases (KDD)
  * knowledge extracton
  * data analysis
  * information harvesting
## Potentional Application
* Data analysis and decision support
  * Market analysis and management
    * This include specifically targeting customers, market basket analysis and market segmentation etc
  * Risk analysis and management
    * Forecasting, customer retention, improved underwriting, quality control and competitive analysis
* Other Applications
  * Text miining (ie. reddit, email) ~ Web mining for sentiment analysis etc
  * Stream data mining (ie. twitter, live flow of information that's constantly incoming)
# Market Analysis and Management
* Where do we get this data from?
  * Cred card transation
  * Loyality cards
  * Discount coupons
  * Customer complaint calls
  * Lifestyle studies
* Target marketing
  * Finding clusters of "model" 
  * Determine customer purchasing patterns over time
* Cross-market analysis
  * Association/co-relations between product & prediction based on such association
* Customer profiling
  * What types of customer buy what products (clustering or classification)
* Customer requirement analysis
  * Identifying the best products for different cusotmers
  * Predict what factors will attract new customers
* Provision of summary information
  * Multidimensional summary reports
  * Statistical summary infomation
